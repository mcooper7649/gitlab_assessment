Ever since I was a small child I've been a collector of cards. Football, Baseball, Garbase Pale Kids, it didn't matter. I loved collecting them due to the cool designs, rare finds, and I guess a bit of nostalgia these days.
As all collectors know, not too much has changed in that space in over a hundred years, cards are still physical with new releases, typically launched anually.
So recently I stumbled upon the concept of Dynamic NFTs from the Chainlink web3 team.

> "This static NFT model provides a host of benefits for digital artists around the world. Beforehand, digital artists were unable to stop, or even track, unauthorized distribution of their original artwork, because there was no means by which to distinguish the difference between any two files and therefore no single authentic file that could be owned. For the first time in the history of the Internet, creators can sell digital art to their fans by giving them verifiable ownership, while fans can prove that they own an original artwork even if the underlying image is copied."
> "However, this model is limited by the permanence of static NFTs, because the metadata attached to them is fixed once they’re minted on a blockchain. Use cases such as tokenizing real-world assets, building progression-based video games, or creating blockchain-based fantasy sports leagues often require data to be updated. dNFTs offer a best-of-both-worlds approach, with NFTs retaining their unique identifiers while able to update aspects of their metadata."

> "Put simply, a dynamic NFT is an NFT that can change based on external conditions. Change in a dynamic NFT often refers to changes in the NFT’s metadata triggered by a smart contract. This is done by encoding automatic changes within the NFT smart contract, which provides instructions to the underlying NFT regarding when and how its metadata should change."

This may not seem impactful intially but for a card collector as myself it greatly improves the value of NFTs. Think about it like this, a rookie card currently of a static NFT or classic baseball card the statistics on the back never change, the photo of our players changes as they age or evolve. Dynamic NFTs throw the old concepts out the window.

In the future card collector can open a pack of NFTs. They may receive a Lebron Jr rookie card. This may have a great intial value but as the player ages the statistics or metadata on the card can change. Truly creating a high value and more interactive experience than ever before.

This is just one of many different spaces Dynamic NFTs can impact, think of NFTs for Deed to your Home or Vehicle with metadata containing latest improvements/repairs/mileage. I may be optimistic but I can see Dynamic NFTs making your gaming experience profitable with loot box or character skills that can be enhanced and provably rare unlocking the potential for full time gaming careers as the digital resale market should expand immensely.

For someone like me who loves future-ology, Dynamic NFTs aren't only cool, they are needed for the future technology visions of the past to become the present.
